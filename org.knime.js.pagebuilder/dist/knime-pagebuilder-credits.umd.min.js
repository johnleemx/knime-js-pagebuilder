But don\'t forget to whitelist it for transpilation:\\n\\n```js\\nimport consola from \'consola/src/node\'\\nimport consola from \'consola/src/browser\'\\n```\\n\\n## Methods\\n\\n#### `<type>(logObject)` `<type>(args...)`\\n\\nLog to all reporters.\\n\\nExample: `consola.info(\'Message\')`\\n\\nA list of available types can be found [here](./src/types.js).\\n\\n#### `addReporter(reporter)`\\n\\n- Aliases: `add`\\n\\nRegister a custom reporter instance.\\n\\n#### `removeReporter(reporter?)`\\n\\n- Aliases: `remove`, `clear`\\n\\nRemove a registered reporter.\\n\\nIf no arguments are passed all reporters will be removed.\\n\\n#### `setReporters(reporter|reporter[])`\\n\\nReplace all reporters.\\n\\n#### `create(options)`\\n\\nCreate a new `Consola` instance and inherit all parent options for defaults.\\n\\n#### `withDefaults(defaults)`\\n\\nCreate a new `Consola` instance with provided defaults\\n\\n#### `withTag(tag)`\\n\\n- Aliases: `withScope`\\n\\nCreate a new `Consola` instance with that tag.\\n\\n#### `wrapConsole()` `restoreConsole()`\\n\\nGlobally redirect all `console.log`, etc calls to consola handlers.\\n\\n#### `wrapStd()` `restoreStd()`\\n\\nGlobally redirect all stdout/stderr outputs to consola.\\n\\n#### `wrapAll()` `restoreAll()`\\n\\nWrap both, std and console.\\n\\nconsole uses std in the underlying so calling `wrapStd` redirects console too.\\nBenefit of this function is that things like `console.info` will be correctly redirected to the corresponding type.\\n\\n#### `pauseLogs()` `resumeLogs()`\\n\\n- Aliases: `pause`/`resume`\\n\\n**Globally** pause and resume logs.\\n\\nConsola will enqueue all logs when paused and then sends them to the reported when resumed.\\n\\n#### `mockTypes`\\n\\n- Aliases: `mock`\\n\\nMock all types. Useful for using with tests.\\n\\nThe first argument passed to `mockTypes` should be a callback function accepting `(typeName, type)` and returning the mocked value:\\n\\n```js\\nconsola.mockTypes((typeName, type) => jest.fn())\\n```\\n\\nPlease note that with the example above, everything is mocked independently for each type. If you need one mocked fn create it outside:\\n\\n```js\\nconst fn = jest.fn()\\nconsola.mockTypes(() => fn)\\n```\\n\\nIf callback function returns a _falsy_ value, that type won\'t be mocked.\\n\\nFor example if you just need to mock `consola.fatal`:\\n\\n```js\\nconsola.mockTypes((typeName) => typeName === \'fatal\' && jest.fn())\\n```\\n\\n**NOTE:** Any instance of consola that inherits the mocked instance, will apply provided callback again.\\nThis way, mocking works for `withTag` scoped loggers without need to extra efforts.\\n\\n## Fields\\n\\n#### `reporters`\\n\\nAn array of active reporters.\\n\\n#### `level`\\n\\nThe level to display logs. Any logs at or above this level will be displayed.\\nList of available levels [here](./src/types.js).\\n\\nYou can set log level using `CONSOLA_LEVEL` environment variable.\\n\\n## `logObject`\\n\\nThe `logObject` is a free-to-extend object which will be passed to reporters.\\n\\nStandard fields:\\n\\n- `message`\\n- `additional`\\n- `args`\\n- `date`\\n- `tag`\\n\\nExtra fields:\\n\\n- `badge`\\n\\n## Reporters\\n\\nChoose between one of the built-in reporters or bring in your own one.\\n\\nBy default `FancyReporter` is registered for modern terminals or `BasicReporter` will be used if running in limited environments such as CIs.\\n\\nAvailable reporters:\\n\\n- [BasicReporter](./src/reporters/basic.js)\\n- [FancyReporter](./src/reporters/fancy.js)\\n- [JSONReporter](./src/reporters/json.js)\\n- [WinstonReporter](./src/reporters/winston.js)\\n\\n### Creating your own reporter\\n\\nA reporter (class or object) exposes `log(logObj)` method.\\nTo get more info about how to write your own reporter, take a look into the linked implementations above.\\n\\n## Types\\n\\nTypes are used to actually log messages to the reporters.\\nEach type is attached to a _logging level_.\\n\\nA list of all available default types is [here](./src/types.js).\\n\\n## Creating a new instance\\n\\nConsola has a global instance and is recommended to use everywhere.\\nIn case more control is needed, create a new instance.\\n\\n```js\\nimport consola from \'consola\'\\n\\nconst logger = consola.create({\\n    // level: 4,\\n    reporters: [\\n      new consola.JSONReporter()\\n    ],\\n    defaults: {\\n      additionalColor: \'white\'\\n    }\\n})\\n```\\n\\n## Integrations\\n\\n### With jest\\n\\n```js\\ndescribe(\'your-consola-mock-test\', () => {\\n  beforeAll(() => {\\n      // Redirect std and console to consola too\\n      // Calling this once is sufficient\\n      consola.wrapAll()\\n    })\\n\\n    beforeEach(() => {\\n      // Re-mock consola before each test call to remove\\n      // calls from before\\n      consola.mockTypes(() => jest.fn())\\n    })\\n\\n\\n  test(\'your test\', async () => {\\n    // Some code here\\n\\n    // Let\'s retrieve all messages of `consola.log`\\n    // Get the mock and map all calls to their first argument\\n    const consolaMessages = consola.log.mock.calls.map(c => c[0])\\n    expect(consolaMessages).toContain(\'your message\')\\n  })\\n\\n})\\n```\\n\\n### With jsdom\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n  virtualConsole: new jsdom.VirtualConsole().sendTo(consola)\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## License\\n\\nMIT - Made with üíñ By Nuxt.js team!\\n\\n\x3c!-- Refs --\x3e\\n[standard-js-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/badge/code%20style/standard/green\\n[standard-js-href]: https://standardjs.com\\n\\n[npm-version-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/npm/v/consola/latest\\n[npm-version-href]: https://npmjs.com/package/consola\\n\\n[npm-downloads-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/npm/dt/consola\\n[npm-downloads-href]: https://npmjs.com/package/consola\\n\\n[package-phobia-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/packagephobia/install/consola\\n[package-phobia-href]: https://packagephobia.now.sh/result?p=consola\\n\\n[bundle-phobia-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/bundlephobia/minzip/consola\\n[bundle-phobia-href]: https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=consola"},{"name":"core-js","repository":"https://github.com/zloirock/core-js","licenseText":"Copyright (c) 2014-2019 Denis Pushkarev\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\"Software\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Licensors should read and understand the terms\\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\\n     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\\n     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\\n     licensed material, or material used under an exception or\\n     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\\n\\twiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\\n\\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\\n     the licensor\'s permission is not necessary for any reason--for\\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\\n\\n  f.

Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\\n     under this Public License.\\n\\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\\n     individually chosen by them.\\n\\n  j.

Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\\n          6(a).\\n\\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so.

For purposes of this Public License,\\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\\n\\n       5. Downstream recipients.\\n\\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\\n               Public License.\\n\\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\\n               Material.\\n\\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\\n\\n  b. Other rights.\\n\\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\\n\\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\\n          Public License.\\n\\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\\n\\n\\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\\n\\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\\nfollowing conditions.\\n\\n  a. Attribution.\\n\\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\\n          form), You must:\\n\\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\\n               with the Licensed Material:\\n\\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\\n                    designated);\\n\\n                ii. a copyright notice;\\n\\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\\n\\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\\n                    warranties;\\n\\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\\n\\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\\n\\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\\n\\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\\n          information.\\n\\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\\n          reasonably practicable.\\n\\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter\'s\\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\\n\\n\\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\\n\\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\\n\\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\\n     portion of the contents of the database;\\n\\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\\n\\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\\n\\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\\n\\n\\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\\n\\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\\n\\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\\n\\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\\n     waiver of all liability.\\n\\n\\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\\n\\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\\n     terminate automatically.\\n\\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\\n\\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\\n          violation; or\\n\\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\\n\\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\\n     of this Public License.\\n\\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\\n     will not terminate this Public License.\\n\\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\\n     License.\\n\\n\\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\\n\\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\\n\\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\\n\\n\\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\\n\\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\\n\\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\\n     conditions.\\n\\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\\n     Licensor.\\n\\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\\n\\n\\n=======================================================================\\n\\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\\nlicenses.

But don\'t forget to whitelist it for transpilation:\\n\\n```js\\nimport consola from \'consola/src/node\'\\nimport consola from \'consola/src/browser\'\\n```\\n\\n## Methods\\n\\n#### `<type>(logObject)` `<type>(args...)`\\n\\nLog to all reporters.\\n\\nExample: `consola.info(\'Message\')`\\n\\nA list of available types can be found [here](./src/types.js).\\n\\n#### `addReporter(reporter)`\\n\\n- Aliases: `add`\\n\\nRegister a custom reporter instance.\\n\\n#### `removeReporter(reporter?)`\\n\\n- Aliases: `remove`, `clear`\\n\\nRemove a registered reporter.\\n\\nIf no arguments are passed all reporters will be removed.\\n\\n#### `setReporters(reporter|reporter[])`\\n\\nReplace all reporters.\\n\\n#### `create(options)`\\n\\nCreate a new `Consola` instance and inherit all parent options for defaults.\\n\\n#### `withDefaults(defaults)`\\n\\nCreate a new `Consola` instance with provided defaults\\n\\n#### `withTag(tag)`\\n\\n- Aliases: `withScope`\\n\\nCreate a new `Consola` instance with that tag.\\n\\n#### `wrapConsole()` `restoreConsole()`\\n\\nGlobally redirect all `console.log`, etc calls to consola handlers.\\n\\n#### `wrapStd()` `restoreStd()`\\n\\nGlobally redirect all stdout/stderr outputs to consola.\\n\\n#### `wrapAll()` `restoreAll()`\\n\\nWrap both, std and console.\\n\\nconsole uses std in the underlying so calling `wrapStd` redirects console too.\\nBenefit of this function is that things like `console.info` will be correctly redirected to the corresponding type.\\n\\n#### `pauseLogs()` `resumeLogs()`\\n\\n- Aliases: `pause`/`resume`\\n\\n**Globally** pause and resume logs.\\n\\nConsola will enqueue all logs when paused and then sends them to the reported when resumed.\\n\\n#### `mockTypes`\\n\\n- Aliases: `mock`\\n\\nMock all types. Useful for using with tests.\\n\\nThe first argument passed to `mockTypes` should be a callback function accepting `(typeName, type)` and returning the mocked value:\\n\\n```js\\nconsola.mockTypes((typeName, type) => jest.fn())\\n```\\n\\nPlease note that with the example above, everything is mocked independently for each type. If you need one mocked fn create it outside:\\n\\n```js\\nconst fn = jest.fn()\\nconsola.mockTypes(() => fn)\\n```\\n\\nIf callback function returns a _falsy_ value, that type won\'t be mocked.\\n\\nFor example if you just need to mock `consola.fatal`:\\n\\n```js\\nconsola.mockTypes((typeName) => typeName === \'fatal\' && jest.fn())\\n```\\n\\n**NOTE:** Any instance of consola that inherits the mocked instance, will apply provided callback again.\\nThis way, mocking works for `withTag` scoped loggers without need to extra efforts.\\n\\n## Fields\\n\\n#### `reporters`\\n\\nAn array of active reporters.\\n\\n#### `level`\\n\\nThe level to display logs. Any logs at or above this level will be displayed.\\nList of available levels [here](./src/types.js).\\n\\nYou can set log level using `CONSOLA_LEVEL` environment variable.\\n\\n## `logObject`\\n\\nThe `logObject` is a free-to-extend object which will be passed to reporters.\\n\\nStandard fields:\\n\\n- `message`\\n- `additional`\\n- `args`\\n- `date`\\n- `tag`\\n\\nExtra fields:\\n\\n- `badge`\\n\\n## Reporters\\n\\nChoose between one of the built-in reporters or bring in your own one.\\n\\nBy default `FancyReporter` is registered for modern terminals or `BasicReporter` will be used if running in limited environments such as CIs.\\n\\nAvailable reporters:\\n\\n- [BasicReporter](./src/reporters/basic.js)\\n- [FancyReporter](./src/reporters/fancy.js)\\n- [JSONReporter](./src/reporters/json.js)\\n- [WinstonReporter](./src/reporters/winston.js)\\n\\n### Creating your own reporter\\n\\nA reporter (class or object) exposes `log(logObj)` method.\\nTo get more info about how to write your own reporter, take a look into the linked implementations above.\\n\\n## Types\\n\\nTypes are used to actually log messages to the reporters.\\nEach type is attached to a _logging level_.\\n\\nA list of all available default types is [here](./src/types.js).\\n\\n## Creating a new instance\\n\\nConsola has a global instance and is recommended to use everywhere.\\nIn case more control is needed, create a new instance.\\n\\n```js\\nimport consola from \'consola\'\\n\\nconst logger = consola.create({\\n    // level: 4,\\n    reporters: [\\n      new consola.JSONReporter()\\n    ],\\n    defaults: {\\n      additionalColor: \'white\'\\n    }\\n})\\n```\\n\\n## Integrations\\n\\n### With jest\\n\\n```js\\ndescribe(\'your-consola-mock-test\', () => {\\n  beforeAll(() => {\\n      // Redirect std and console to consola too\\n      // Calling this once is sufficient\\n      consola.wrapAll()\\n    })\\n\\n    beforeEach(() => {\\n      // Re-mock consola before each test call to remove\\n      // calls from before\\n      consola.mockTypes(() => jest.fn())\\n    })\\n\\n\\n  test(\'your test\', async () => {\\n    // Some code here\\n\\n    // Let\'s retrieve all messages of `consola.log`\\n    // Get the mock and map all calls to their first argument\\n    const consolaMessages = consola.log.mock.calls.map(c => c[0])\\n    expect(consolaMessages).toContain(\'your message\')\\n  })\\n\\n})\\n```\\n\\n### With jsdom\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n  virtualConsole: new jsdom.VirtualConsole().sendTo(consola)\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## License\\n\\nMIT - Made with 💖 By Nuxt.js team!\\n\\n\x3c!-- Refs --\x3e\\n[standard-js-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/badge/code%20style/standard/green\\n[standard-js-href]: https://standardjs.com\\n\\n[npm-version-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/npm/v/consola/latest\\n[npm-version-href]: https://npmjs.com/package/consola\\n\\n[npm-downloads-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/npm/dt/consola\\n[npm-downloads-href]: https://npmjs.com/package/consola\\n\\n[package-phobia-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/packagephobia/install/consola\\n[package-phobia-href]: https://packagephobia.now.sh/result?p=consola\\n\\n[bundle-phobia-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/bundlephobia/minzip/consola\\n[bundle-phobia-href]: https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=consola"},{"name":"convert-source-map","repository":"https://github.com/thlorenz/convert-source-map","licenseText":"Copyright 2013 Thorsten Lorenz. \\nAll rights reserved.\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\\nfiles (the \\"Software\\"), to deal in the Software without\\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\\nconditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\\n\\n```html\\n<script type=\\"text/javascript\\" src=\\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\\"><\/script>\\n<script>\\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\\n<\/script>\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install imurmurhash\\n```\\n\\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\\n\\n```javascript\\nMurmurHash3 = require(\'imurmurhash\');\\n```\\n\\nQuick Example\\n-------------\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Create the initial hash\\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3(\'string\');\\n\\n// Incrementally add text\\nhashState.hash(\'more strings\');\\nhashState.hash(\'even more strings\');\\n\\n// All calls can be chained if desired\\nhashState.hash(\'and\').hash(\'some\').hash(\'more\');\\n\\n// Get a result\\nhashState.result();\\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\\n```\\n\\nFunctions\\n---------\\n\\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\\n...\\n\\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\\n```\\n\\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Do the whole string at once\\nMurmurHash3(\'this is a test string\').result();\\n// 0x70529328\\n\\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\\nvar m = MurmurHash3(\'this is a\');\\nm.result();\\n// 0xbfc4f834\\nm.hash(\' test string\').result();\\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor).

[![Build][]][1] [![Coverage][]][2]\\n===============\\n\\nCompare strings containing a mix of letters and numbers\\nin the way a human being would in sort order.\\nThis is described as a \\"natural ordering\\".\\n\\n```text\\nStandard sorting:   Natural order sorting:\\n    img1.png            img1.png\\n    img10.png           img2.png\\n    img12.png           img10.png\\n    img2.png            img12.png\\n```\\n\\nString.naturalCompare returns a number indicating\\nwhether a reference string comes before or after or is the same\\nas the given string in sort order.\\nUse it with builtin sort() function.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Installation\\n\\n- In browser\\n\\n```html\\n<script src=min.natural-compare.js><\/script>\\n```\\n\\n- In node.js: `npm install natural-compare-lite`\\n\\n```javascript\\nrequire(\\"natural-compare-lite\\")\\n```\\n\\n### Usage\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Simple case sensitive example\\nvar a = [\\"z1.doc\\", \\"z10.doc\\", \\"z17.doc\\", \\"z2.doc\\", \\"z23.doc\\", \\"z3.doc\\"];\\na.sort(String.naturalCompare);\\n// [\\"z1.doc\\", \\"z2.doc\\", \\"z3.doc\\", \\"z10.doc\\", \\"z17.doc\\", \\"z23.doc\\"]\\n\\n// Use wrapper function for case insensitivity\\na.sort(function(a, b){\\n  return String.naturalCompare(a.toLowerCase(), b.toLowerCase());\\n})\\n\\n// In most cases we want to sort an array of objects\\nvar a = [ {\\"street\\":\\"350 5th Ave\\", \\"room\\":\\"A-1021\\"}\\n        , {\\"street\\":\\"350 5th Ave\\", \\"room\\":\\"A-21046-b\\"} ];\\n\\n// sort by street, then by room\\na.sort(function(a, b){\\n  return String.naturalCompare(a.street, b.street) || String.naturalCompare(a.room, b.room);\\n})\\n\\n// When text transformation is needed (eg toLowerCase()),\\n// it is best for performance to keep\\n// transformed key in that object.\\n// There are no need to do text transformation\\n// on each comparision when sorting.\\nvar a = [ {\\"make\\":\\"Audi\\", \\"model\\":\\"A6\\"}\\n        , {\\"make\\":\\"Kia\\",  \\"model\\":\\"Rio\\"} ];\\n\\n// sort by make, then by model\\na.map(function(car){\\n  car.sort_key = (car.make + \\" \\" + car.model).toLowerCase();\\n})\\na.sort(function(a, b){\\n  return String.naturalCompare(a.sort_key, b.sort_key);\\n})\\n```\\n\\n- Works well with dates in ISO format eg \\"Rev 2012-07-26.doc\\".\\n\\n\\n### Custom alphabet\\n\\nIt is possible to configure a custom alphabet\\nto achieve a desired order.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Estonian alphabet\\nString.alphabet = \\"ABDEFGHIJKLMNOPRSŠZŽTUVÕÄÖÜXYabdefghijklmnoprsšzžtuvõäöüxy\\"\\n[\\"t\\", \\"z\\", \\"x\\", \\"õ\\"].sort(String.naturalCompare)\\n// [\\"z\\", \\"t\\", \\"õ\\", \\"x\\"]\\n\\n// Russian alphabet\\nString.alphabet = \\"АБВГДЕЁЖЗИЙКЛМНОПРСТУФХЦЧШЩЪЫЬЭЮЯабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя\\"\\n[\\"Ё\\", \\"А\\", \\"Б\\"].sort(String.naturalCompare)\\n// [\\"А\\", \\"Б\\", \\"Ё\\"]\\n```\\n\\n\\nExternal links\\n--------------\\n\\n-   [GitHub repo][https://github.com/litejs/natural-compare-lite]\\n-   [jsperf test](http://jsperf.com/natural-sort-2/12)\\n\\n\\nLicence\\n-------\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2012-2015 Lauri Rooden &lt;lauri@rooden.ee&gt;

It\'s is pretty much everything that ends up in the parsed result. Each node has these properties:\\r\\n\\r\\n* `type`: the type of the node (see below);\\r\\n* `value`: the node\'s value stripped of trailing whitespaces;\\r\\n* `sourceIndex`: 0-based index of the node start relative to the source start (excluding trailing whitespaces);\\r\\n* `before`: a string that contain a whitespace between the node start and the previous node end/source start;\\r\\n* `after`: a string that contain a whitespace between the node end and the next node start/source end;\\r\\n* `parent`: a link to this node\'s parent node (a container).\\r\\n\\r\\nA node can have one of these types (according to [the 2012 CSS3 standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-css3-mediaqueries-20120619/)):\\r\\n\\r\\n* `media-query-list`: that is the root level node of the parsing result. A [container](#containers); its children can have types of `url` and `media-query`.\\r\\n* `url`: if a source is taken from a CSS `@import` rule, it will have a `url(...)` function call. The value of such node will be `url(http://uri-address)`, it is to be parsed separately.\\r\\n* `media-query`: such nodes correspond to each media query in a comma separated list. In the exapmle above there are two. Nodes of this type are [containers](#containers).\\r\\n* `media-type`: `screen`, `tv` and other media types.\\r\\n* `keyword`: `only`, `not` or `and` keyword.\\r\\n* `media-feature-expression`: an expression in parentheses that checks for a condition of a particular media feature. The value would be like this: `(max-width: 1000px)`. Such nodes are [containers](#containers). They always have a `media-feature` child node, but might not have a `value` child node (like in `screen and (color)`).\\r\\n* `media-feature`: a media feature, e.g. `max-width`.\\r\\n* `colon`: present if a media feature expression has a colon (e.g. `(min-width: 1000px)`, compared to `(color)`).\\r\\n* `value`: a media feature expression value, e.g. `100px` in `(max-width: 1000px)`.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Parsing details\\r\\n\\r\\npostcss-media-query-parser allows for cases of some **non-standard syntaxes** and tries its best to work them around. For example, in a media query from a code with SCSS syntax:\\r\\n\\r\\n```scss\\r\\n@media #{$media-type} and ( #{\\"max-width\\" + \\": 10px\\"} ) { ... }\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n`#{$media-type}` will be the node of type `media-type`, alghough `$media-type`\'s value can be `only screen`. And inside `media-feature-expression` there will only be a `media-feature` type node with the value of `#{\\"max-width\\" + \\": 10px\\"}` (this example doesn\'t make much sense, it\'s for demo purpose).\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the result of parsing **malformed media queries** (such as with incorrect amount of closing parens, curly braces, etc.) can be unexpected. For exapmle, parsing:\\r\\n\\r\\n```scss\\r\\n@media ((min-width: -100px)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nwould return a media query list with the single `media-query` node that has no child nodes.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Containers\\r\\n\\r\\nContainers are [nodes](#nodes) that have other nodes as children. Container nodes have an additional property `nodes` which is an array of their child nodes. And also these methods:\\r\\n\\r\\n* `each(callback)` - traverses the direct child nodes of a container, calling `callback` function for each of them. Returns `false` if traversing has stopped by means of `callback` returning `false`, and `true` otherwise.\\r\\n* `walk([filter, ]callback)` - traverses ALL descendant nodes of a container, calling `callback` function for each of them. Returns `false` if traversing has stopped by means of `callback` returning `false`, and `true` otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn both cases `callback` takes these parameters:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `node` - the current node (one of the container\'s descendats, that the callback has been called against).\\r\\n- `i` - 0-based index of the `node` in an array of its parent\'s children.\\r\\n- `nodes` - array of child nodes of `node`\'s parent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf `callback` returns `false`, the traversing stops.\\r\\n\\r\\n## License\\r\\n\\r\\nMIT"},{"name":"postcss-reporter","repository":"https://github.com/postcss/postcss-reporter","licenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2015 David Clark\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\"Software\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

options])`\\n\\nConfigure the `processor` to read markdown as input and process\\n[**mdast**][mdast] syntax trees.\\n\\n##### `options`\\n\\nOptions are passed directly, or passed later through [`processor.data()`][data].\\n\\n##### `options.gfm`\\n\\n```md\\nhello ~~hi~~ world\\n```\\n\\nGFM mode (`boolean`, default: `true`) turns on:\\n\\n*   [Fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks)\\n*   [Autolinking of URLs](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#url-autolinking)\\n*   [Deletions (strikethrough)](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#strikethrough)\\n*   [Task lists](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/#task-lists)\\n*   [Tables](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#tables)\\n\\n##### `options.commonmark`\\n\\n```md\\nThis is a paragraph\\n    and this is also part of the preceding paragraph.\\n```\\n\\nCommonMark mode (`boolean`, default: `false`) allows:\\n\\n*   Empty lines to split blockquotes\\n*   Parentheses (`(` and `)`) around for link and image titles\\n*   Any escaped [ASCII-punctuation][escapes] character\\n*   Closing parenthesis (`)`) as an ordered list marker\\n*   URL definitions (and footnotes, when enabled) in blockquotes\\n\\nCommonMark mode disallows:\\n\\n*   Code directly following a paragraph\\n*   ATX-headings (`# Hash headings`) without spacing after opening hashes\\n    or and before closing hashes\\n*   Setext headings (`Underline headings\\\\n---`) when following a paragraph\\n*   Newlines in link and image titles\\n*   White space in link and image URLs in auto-links (links in brackets,\\n    `<` and `>`)\\n*   Lazy blockquote continuation, lines not preceded by a closing angle\\n    bracket (`>`), for lists, code, and thematicBreak\\n\\n##### `options.footnotes`\\n\\n```md\\nSomething something[^or something?].\\n\\nAnd something else[^1].\\n\\n[^1]: This reference footnote contains a paragraph...\\n\\n    * ...and a list\\n```\\n\\nFootnotes mode (`boolean`, default: `false`) enables reference footnotes and\\ninline footnotes.  Both are wrapped in square brackets and preceded by a caret\\n(`^`), and can be referenced from inside other footnotes.\\n\\n##### `options.blocks`\\n\\n```md\\n<block>foo\\n</block>\\n```\\n\\nBlocks (`Array.<string>`, default: list of [block HTML elements][blocks])\\nexposes let’s users define block-level HTML elements.\\n\\n##### `options.pedantic`\\n\\n```md\\nCheck out some_file_name.txt\\n```\\n\\nPedantic mode (`boolean`, default: `false`) turns on:\\n\\n*   Emphasis (`_alpha_`) and importance (`__bravo__`) with underscores\\n    in words\\n*   Unordered lists with different markers (`*`, `-`, `+`)\\n*   If `commonmark` is also turned on, ordered lists with different\\n    markers (`.`, `)`)\\n*   And pedantic mode removes less spaces in list-items (at most four,\\n    instead of the whole indent)\\n\\n### `parse.Parser`\\n\\nAccess to the [parser][], if you need it.\\n\\n## Extending the Parser\\n\\nMost often, using transformers to manipulate a syntax tree produces\\nthe desired output.  Sometimes, mainly when introducing new syntactic\\nentities with a certain level of precedence, interfacing with the parser\\nis necessary.\\n\\nIf the `remark-parse` plugin is used, it adds a [`Parser`][parser] constructor\\nto the `processor`.  Other plugins can add tokenizers to the parser’s prototype\\nto change how markdown is parsed.\\n\\nThe below plugin adds a [tokenizer][] for at-mentions.\\n\\n```js\\nmodule.exports = mentions\\n\\nfunction mentions() {\\n  var Parser = this.Parser\\n  var tokenizers = Parser.prototype.inlineTokenizers\\n  var methods = Parser.prototype.inlineMethods\\n\\n  // Add an inline tokenizer (defined in the following example).\\n  tokenizers.mention = tokenizeMention\\n\\n  // Run it just before `text`.\\n  methods.splice(methods.indexOf(\'text\'), 0, \'mention\')\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### `Parser#blockTokenizers`\\n\\nAn object mapping tokenizer names to [tokenizer][]s.  These\\ntokenizers (for example: `fencedCode`, `table`, and `paragraph`) eat\\nfrom the start of a value to a line ending.\\n\\nSee `#blockMethods` below for a list of methods that are included by\\ndefault.\\n\\n### `Parser#blockMethods`\\n\\nArray of `blockTokenizers` names (`string`) specifying the order in\\nwhich they run.\\n\\n\x3c!--methods-block start--\x3e\\n\\n*   `newline`\\n*   `indentedCode`\\n*   `fencedCode`\\n*   `blockquote`\\n*   `atxHeading`\\n*   `thematicBreak`\\n*   `list`\\n*   `setextHeading`\\n*   `html`\\n*   `footnote`\\n*   `definition`\\n*   `table`\\n*   `paragraph`\\n\\n\x3c!--methods-block end--\x3e\\n\\n### `Parser#inlineTokenizers`\\n\\nAn object mapping tokenizer names to [tokenizer][]s.  These tokenizers\\n(for example: `url`, `reference`, and `emphasis`) eat from the start\\nof a value.  To increase performance, they depend on [locator][]s.\\n\\nSee `#inlineMethods` below for a list of methods that are included by\\ndefault.\\n\\n### `Parser#inlineMethods`\\n\\nArray of `inlineTokenizers` names (`string`) specifying the order in\\nwhich they run.\\n\\n\x3c!--methods-inline start--\x3e\\n\\n*   `escape`\\n*   `autoLink`\\n*   `url`\\n*   `html`\\n*   `link`\\n*   `reference`\\n*   `strong`\\n*   `emphasis`\\n*   `deletion`\\n*   `code`\\n*   `break`\\n*   `text`\\n\\n\x3c!--methods-inline end--\x3e\\n\\n### `function tokenizer(eat, value, silent)`\\n\\n```js\\ntokenizeMention.notInLink = true\\ntokenizeMention.locator = locateMention\\n\\nfunction tokenizeMention(eat, value, silent) {\\n  var match = /^@(\\\\w+)/.exec(value)\\n\\n  if (match) {\\n    if (silent) {\\n      return true\\n    }\\n\\n    return eat(match[0])({\\n      type: \'link\',\\n      url: \'https://social-network/\' + match[1],\\n      children: [{type: \'text\', value: match[0]}]\\n    })\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe parser knows two types of tokenizers: block level and inline level.\\nBlock level tokenizers are the same as inline level tokenizers, with\\nthe exception that the latter must have a [locator][].\\n\\nTokenizers _test_ whether a document starts with a certain syntactic\\nentity.  In _silent_ mode, they return whether that test passes.\\nIn _normal_ mode, they consume that token, a process which is called\\n“eating”.  Locators enable tokenizers to function faster by providing\\ninformation on where the next entity may occur.\\n\\n###### Signatures\\n\\n*   `Node? = tokenizer(eat, value)`\\n*   `boolean? = tokenizer(eat, value, silent)`\\n\\n###### Parameters\\n\\n*   `eat` ([`Function`][eat]) — Eat, when applicable, an entity\\n*   `value` (`string`) — Value which may start an entity\\n*   `silent` (`boolean`, optional) — Whether to detect or consume\\n\\n###### Properties\\n\\n*   `locator` ([`Function`][locator])\\n    — Required for inline tokenizers\\n*   `onlyAtStart` (`boolean`)\\n    — Whether nodes can only be found at the beginning of the document\\n*   `notInBlock` (`boolean`)\\n    — Whether nodes cannot be in blockquotes, lists, or footnote\\n    definitions\\n*   `notInList` (`boolean`)\\n    — Whether nodes cannot be in lists\\n*   `notInLink` (`boolean`)\\n    — Whether nodes cannot be in links\\n\\n###### Returns\\n\\n*   In _silent_ mode, whether a node can be found at the start of `value`\\n*   In _normal_ mode, a node if it can be found at the start of `value`\\n\\n### `tokenizer.locator(value, fromIndex)`\\n\\n```js\\nfunction locateMention(value, fromIndex) {\\n  return value.indexOf(\'@\', fromIndex)\\n}\\n```\\n\\nLocators are required for inline tokenization to keep the process\\nperformant.  Locators enable inline tokenizers to function faster by\\nproviding information on the where the next entity occurs.  Locators\\nmay be wrong, it’s OK if there actually isn’t a node to be found at\\nthe index they return, but they must skip any nodes.\\n\\n###### Parameters\\n\\n*   `value` (`string`) — Value which may contain an entity\\n*   `fromIndex` (`number`) — Position to start searching at\\n\\n###### Returns\\n\\nIndex at which an entity may start, and `-1` otherwise.\\n\\n### `eat(subvalue)`\\n\\n```js\\nvar add = eat(\'foo\')\\n```\\n\\nEat `subvalue`, which is a string at the start of the\\n[tokenize][tokenizer]d `value` (it’s tracked to ensure the correct\\nvalue is eaten).\\n\\n###### Parameters\\n\\n*   `subvalue` (`string`) - Value to eat.\\n\\n###### Returns\\n\\n[`add`][add].\\n\\n### `add(node[, parent])`\\n\\n```js\\nvar add = eat(\'foo\')\\n\\nadd({type: \'text\', value: \'foo\'})\\n```\\n\\nAdd [positional information][location] to `node` and add it to `parent`.\\n\\n###### Parameters\\n\\n*   `node` ([`Node`][node]) - Node to patch position on and insert\\n*   `parent` ([`Node`][node], optional) - Place to add `node` to in\\n    the syntax tree.  Defaults to the currently processed node\\n\\n###### Returns\\n\\nThe given `node`.\\n\\n### `add.test()`\\n\\nGet the [positional information][location] which would be patched on\\n`node` by `add`.\\n\\n###### Returns\\n\\n[`Location`][location].\\n\\n### `add.reset(node[, parent])`\\n\\n`add`, but resets the internal location.  Useful for example in\\nlists, where the same content is first eaten for a list, and later\\nfor list items\\n\\n###### Parameters\\n\\n*   `node` ([`Node`][node]) - Node to patch position on and insert\\n*   `parent` ([`Node`][node], optional) - Place to add `node` to in\\n    the syntax tree.  Defaults to the currently processed node\\n\\n###### Returns\\n\\nThe given `node`.\\n\\n### Turning off a tokenizer\\n\\nIn rare situations, you may want to turn off a tokenizer to avoid parsing\\nthat syntactic feature.  This can be done by replacing the tokenizer from\\nyour Parser’s `blockTokenizers` (or `blockMethods`) or `inlineTokenizers`\\n(or `inlineMethods`).\\n\\nThe following example turns off indented code blocks:\\n\\n```js\\nremarkParse.Parser.prototype.blockTokenizers.indentedCode = indentedCode\\n\\nfunction indentedCode() {\\n  return true\\n}\\n```\\n\\nPreferably, just use [this plugin](https://github.com/zestedesavoir/zmarkdown/tree/master/packages/remark-disable-tokenizers).\\n\\n## License\\n\\n[MIT][license] © [Titus Wormer][author]\\n\\n\x3c!-- Definitions --\x3e\\n\\n[build-badge]: https://img.shields.io/travis/remarkjs/remark/master.svg\\n\\n[build-status]: https://travis-ci.org/remarkjs/remark\\n\\n[coverage-badge]: https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/remarkjs/remark.svg\\n\\n[coverage-status]: https://codecov.io/github/remarkjs/remark\\n\\n[dl-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/remark-parse.svg\\n\\n[dl]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-parse\\n\\n[size-badge]: https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/remark-parse.svg\\n\\n[size]: https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=remark-parse\\n\\n[chat-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/join%20the%20community-on%20spectrum-7b16ff.svg\\n\\n[chat]: https://spectrum.chat/unified/remark\\n\\n[license]: https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/master/license\\n\\n[author]: https://wooorm.com\\n\\n[npm]: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install\\n\\n[unified]: https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified\\n\\n[data]: https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified#processordatakey-value\\n\\n[processor]: https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/master/packages/remark\\n\\n[mdast]: https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast\\n\\n[escapes]: https://spec.commonmark.org/0.28/#backslash-escapes\\n\\n[node]: https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist#node\\n\\n[location]: https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist#location\\n\\n[parser]: https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified#processorparser\\n\\n[extend]: #extending-the-parser\\n\\n[tokenizer]: #function-tokenizereat-value-silent\\n\\n[locator]: #tokenizerlocatorvalue-fromindex\\n\\n[eat]: #eatsubvalue\\n\\n[add]: #addnode-parent\\n\\n[blocks]: https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/master/packages/remark-parse/lib/block-elements.js\\n\\n[announcement]: https://medium.com/unifiedjs/collectively-evolving-through-crowdsourcing-22c359ea95cc"},{"name":"remark-stringify","repository":"https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-stringify","licenseText":"# remark-stringify [![Travis][build-badge]][build-status] [![Coverage][coverage-badge]][coverage-status] [![Downloads][dl-badge]][dl] [![Size][size-badge]][size] [![Chat][chat-badge]][chat]\\n\\n[Compiler][] for [**unified**][unified].\\nStringifies [**mdast**][mdast] syntax trees to markdown.\\nUsed in the [**remark** processor][processor] but can be used on its own as\\nwell.\\nCan be [extended][extend] to change how markdown is parsed.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Announcing the unified collective!

The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.\\n\\nThe UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.\\n\\n### Breaking changes from 2.x\\n\\nURI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.\\n\\n### Breaking changes from 1.x\\n\\nThe `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.\\n\\n## License ([Simplified BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause))\\n\\nCopyright 2011 Gary Court.
